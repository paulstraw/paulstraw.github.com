A pretty neat article on the OLPC project's distribution of 1000 Android tablets to an Ethiopian village. The children there had apparently never seen written words before, but still managed to use (and eventually "hack") the tablets. After a few months, they figured out how to unlock the devices' cameras (which were disabled by the manufacturer or distributor, apparently).

> Within four minutes, one kid â€¦ found the on/off switch. He'd never seen an on/off switch. He powered it up. Within five days, they were using 47 apps per child per day. Within two weeks, they were singing ABC songs [in English] in the village.
