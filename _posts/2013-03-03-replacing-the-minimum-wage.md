Interesting idea from [moorewr](http://moorewr.tumblr.com/):

> Everyone gets money equal to what the Government claims is the minimum income for subsistence. No questions asked. Want to sit on your ass? The Government [will] cut you a check for $14.5k  per year. After that youâ€™re on your own - no WIC, no subsidized rents, and so on.

I have no idea what kind of social and economic effects this would have, but it would be fascinating to compare against the cost of all the social programs and subsidies it would replace.
