Octopus Creative is bringing on another front-end developer. We spend our time helping awesome companies create great products, and need someone to help us pull all the front-end parts together.

Interested? You should know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript like the back of your hand. Being deeply familiar with things like templating languages, CSS preprocessors, and CoffeeScript is also critical, as is a constant drive to always be improving yourself. If you think you've got what it takes, you should [get in touch](http://www.authenticjobs.com/jobs/16190/front-end-developer).
