Zach Roszczewski just launched his Flaticons icon collection (development courtesy yours truly). It has over 1000 icons, and includes fonts, PNGs, PSDs, and more. There's also a great search tool that lets you drag and drop the PSDs directly into Photoshop from the browser, or copy the CSS class names and unicode values for use with the fonts.
