> It’s not a stretch to imagine that you could immediately be identified by [a] Google Glass user who gets on the bus and turns the camera toward you. Anything you say within earshot could be recorded, associated with the text, and tagged to your online identity. And stored in Google’s search index. Permanently.

Interesting thoughts on a possible dystopian future, starting with Google Glass. This isn't something that concerns me personally (at least not at the moment), but it's definitely important to keep in mind as wearable computing becomes more prevalent.
