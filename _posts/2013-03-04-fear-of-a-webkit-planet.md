After the [recent controversy](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2013/02/and-then-there-were-three.html) over Opera's switch from their in-house rendering engine Presto to WebKit, John Siracusa argues that WebKit's ubiquity is more analogous to Linux than Internet Explorer.

> Linux is the canonical open source success story. It succeeded for reasons that are now so boring they’re accepted as common sense. There’s still plenty of room for variation and innovation, but now all the significant achievements are shared with the world. If a company improves Linux, it’s not just improving its own products; it’s making Linux better for everyone.
